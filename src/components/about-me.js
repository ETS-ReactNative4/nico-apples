          <p className="margin-top-zero line-height-md">My name is Nico, I am a User Experience Designer and creative problem solver based in Sydney. After working as a marketing professional for 7 years, I recently transitioned to the world of UX to satisfy my thirst for creativity and combine it with existing skillsets. I spent many years trying to understand the users‚Äô needs, now I design solutions for them. I am passionate about creating digital experiences that get to the core of the problem and put the users‚Äô needs at the centre of the design process.</p>
          <p className="line-height-md">I am also the proud owner of Cool As A Fox, an e-commerce selling colourful, gender-neutral socks.I started the business with my partner as an outlet to express my creativity and in just two years it has grown from a small side project to a successful e-commerce with over 4000 happy customers in Australia.</p>
          <p className="line-height-md">I also happen to love pizza (without pineapple) and cats. I'd love to tell you more about what gets me excited, let's grab a coffee.</p>
          <p className="line-height-md"><strong>WHY NICO APPLES?</strong> <span role="img" aria-label="apple">üçé </span></p>
          <p className="line-height-md">I love eating apples and I love apple products, but that‚Äôs not the reason behind my nickname. It‚Äôs a lot simpler than that: my last name means apples in Italian. I randomly picked it as my instagram handle a few years ago, and my friends started to call me nicoapples so I got stuck with it.</p>
